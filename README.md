Version Alpha 1.2 script, that helps you track all of your lift blueprints in scrap mechanic.
It changes your blueprint folder modification date as well as your folder name. Basicly something that axolot should've done but didn't.

!!! Warning !!! While using on original game folder, it might cause in-game duplicates to appear, althoe the game will be 100% functional and ~97% sorted. So, DON'T WORRY.

GUIDE:

1. Download the sortowarka_scrap_mechanic.py file by clicking Code > download ZIP

2. Unpack the zip in your prefered location

3. Double click scrap_mechanic_sorter.pyw

4. While in program enter your Blueprints directory location (C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Axolot Games\Scrap Mechanic\User\User\_[number]\Blueprints)  <--- It needs to be a path from your computer and not this particular one. (In case of testing the program on test folder, enter test folder location)

Now you can easily lookup what are your latest creations by looking at directory modification date.

! This program may or may not work on Linux or Mac, althoe I haven't tested it yet. !
! Blueprints may be duplicated due to steam cloud in your main Blueprints folder. !
